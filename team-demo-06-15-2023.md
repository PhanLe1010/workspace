## Kubernetes upgrade with node drain policy

### Background
#### Issue 1
- When user upgrading Kubernetes using automation tools (rancher, System Upgrade Controller,..), the flow is usually: start with a node -> cordon the node -> drain the node -> upgrade kubernetes -> uncordon the node -> move to next node
- The older version of Longhorn require the drain flags `--pod-selector='app!=csi-attacher,app!=csi-provisioner,app!=longhorn-admission-webhook,app!=longhorn-conversion-webhook,app!=longhorn-driver-deployer`
- However, Rancher and  System Upgrade Controller don't allow user to set this flag

#### Issue 2
- When draining a node which has the last replica of the volume, user cannot finish draining even if the last healthy replica is stopped. 
- This is may be desired behavior if the user is planing to remove the worker node as part of Kubernes upgrade
- However, for in-place upgrade/maintenance, this behavior is NOT desired


### New Improvement

#### Improvement 1
- Node draining doesn't require the flag flags `--pod-selector='app!=csi-attacher,app!=csi-provisioner,app!=longhorn-admission-webhook,app!=longhorn-conversion-webhook,app!=longhorn-driver-deployer`

#### Improvement 2
- Introduce a new setting `#### Node Drain Policy` with option `allow-if-replica-is-stopped`: Longhorn will allow the drain when the node contains the last healthy replica of a volume but the replica is stopped. WARNING: possible data loss if the node is removed after draining. Select this option if you want to drain the node and do in-place upgrade/maintenance.
